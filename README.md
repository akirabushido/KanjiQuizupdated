# KanjiQuizupdated
Updated Kanji quiz with Javascript
This is an updated version of the previous quiz. 
I used a 2d array to hold the questions and answers and I loop through it the array.
There is also an option to quit and exit the quiz as well as print out of your score 
and which questions you got correct and which ones you missed.
